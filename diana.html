                    Norfolk. She received the style Lady Diana
                    Spencer in 1975, when her father inherited his Earldom.</p>

                <p>Lady Diana Spencer married The Prince of Wales at St Paul's Cathedral in London on 29 July 1981.</p>

                <p>During her marriage the Princess undertook a wide range of royal duties. Family was very important to
                    the Princess, who had two sons: Prince
                    William and Prince Henry (Harry). After her divorce from The Prince of Wales, the Princess continued
                    to be regarded as a member of the Royal
                    Family.</p>

                <p>Diana, Princess of Wales, died on Sunday, 31 August 1997, following a car crash in Paris.</p>

                <p>There was widespread public mourning at the death of this popular figure, culminating with her
                    funeral at Westminster Abbey on Saturday, 6
                    September 1997.</p>

                <p>Even after her death, the Princess's work lives on in the form of commemorative charities and
                    projects set up to help those in need.</p>
